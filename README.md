# WolframNETLink ðŸ’¥ðŸ”— - Some Tests ðŸ¥¼

Let's look at calling Wolfram [Mathematica locally using .NET](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/tutorial/CallingTheWolframLanguageFromNET.html) (C#) by leveraging the Wolfram .NET/Link library. This allows for running Wolfram Language code directly from .NET applications. I'll want to compare this with WolframAlpha calls over http since the local approach does require some ...

## Setup

(Find a reference for the main .NET/Link namespace at the end of this readme.)

Mainly, point `.csproj` and provision extra dependencies like so, for MM **14.0** (and net8.0) - just add the ItemGroup and Target entries in you New Console Application in Visual Studio.

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Reference Include="Wolfram.NETLink">
      <HintPath>C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\14.0\SystemFiles\Links\NETLink\Wolfram.NETLink.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
  </ItemGroup>

  <Target Name="CopyNativeBinaries" AfterTargets="Build">
    <Copy SourceFiles="C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\14.0\SystemFiles\Links\NETLink\ml64i4.dll"
          DestinationFolder="$(OutDir)" />
  </Target>

</Project>
```

I found that the post-build process _is_ necessary. (May 2024)

## Tech Background: Symbolic Protocol

> [!NOTE]  
> The Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol (WSTP) is a platform-independent protocol for communicating between programs. In more concrete terms, it is a means to send and receive Wolfram Language **expressions**. WSTP is the means by which the notebook front end and kernel communicate with each other. It is also used by a large number of commercial and freeware applications and utilities that link the Wolfram Language and other programs or languages. It is implemented as a library of C-language functions. .NET/Link brings the capabilities of WSTP into .NET in a way that is simpler to use and much more powerful than the raw C-level API.

From [Calling the Wolfram Language from .NET](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/tutorial/CallingTheWolframLanguageFromNET.html) (May 31st, 2024, my **highlight**: we look at [expression](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html) handling on the .NET side in example 2 in the following, but ...) The idea boils down to the following:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Expr class is a representation of arbitrary Mathematica expressions in .NET. Exprs are created by reading an expression from a link (using the GetExpr method), they can be decomposed into component Exprs with properties and methods like Head and Part, and their structure can be queried with methods like Length, NumberQ, and VectorQ. All these methods will be familiar to Mathematica programmers, and their Expr counterparts work similarly.

## Project Structure and Usage

Now we try some different MainImplementations to demonstratre some use cases: the overall project structure follows this diagram.

```
WolframNETLink
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainImplementation1.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainImplementation2.cs
â””â”€â”€ MainImplementation3.cs
```

### General Usage

Follow the setup and start in Visual Studio, then select the implementation want to test out: You will see a Mathematical Kernel instance pop up in the background: **That**'s the basis for this project and what we are testing.

![Screenshot 2024-06-01 143636](https://github.com/heseltime/SWK5-W-WolframNETLink/assets/66922223/c35e7500-5ead-4154-9377-2fcd361aba55)

### Code Template

Each of the implementations called by the console app follow this structure of the Run-method:

```
public static void Run()
{
    // Initialize the Wolfram Engine
    IKernelLink ml = MathLinkFactory.CreateKernelLink();

    try
    {
        // Discard the initial InputNamePacket the kernel will send
        ml.WaitAndDiscardAnswer(); // <-- A detail.

        // Make the call to the kernel
        ml.Evaluate("..."); // <-- Main thing: the expression to evalate is passed as a string
        ml.WaitForAnswer();

        // Read the result back when available
        object result = ml.Get... // the available getters will be listed in a moment
        // --- Now do something with the result, but perhaps check it first
        //        to see if it matches the expectation
    }
    catch (MathLinkException e)
    {
        // MathLink Exception handling
        Console.WriteLine($"MathLinkException: {e.Message}");
    }
    finally
    {
        // Always close the link when done
        ml.Close();
    }
}
```

The available getters provided by MathLink as an object/class (interface, actually) are full listed [in the WL reference](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.IMathLinkMembers.html), here just the ones with "Get" in the name:

// Check the type of the expression
Console.WriteLine("Is the result a list? " + result.ListQ());

// Get the length of the expression (number of parts)
Console.WriteLine("Number of parts: " + result.Length);

// Convert the entire expression to a string
Console.WriteLine("Expression as a string: " + result.StringQ());
```

### MainImplementation1: PrimeFactor 

**A simple example with array conversion to handle evaluation result**

The most interesting code here is the one making the call to the kernel evaluation, inside the template code, storing it in a suitable container and printing to console:

```
// Send a more complex command
ml.Evaluate("FactorInteger[123456789]");
ml.WaitForAnswer();

// Read the result as a 2D array of integers
int[,] factorResult = (int[,])ml.GetArray(typeof(int), 2);
Console.WriteLine("Factors of 123456789:");
for (int i = 0; i < factorResult.GetLength(0); i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Prime: {factorResult[i, 0]}, Exponent: {factorResult[i, 1]}");
}
```

![image](https://github.com/heseltime/SWK5-W-WolframNETLink/assets/66922223/b91d8138-5125-43ff-be7d-d938000d1d57)

**Update**: The correct method for retrieving a 2D array from the Wolfram.NETLink is to use the **GetArray** method

```
// Read the result as a 2D array of integers
object result = ml.GetArray(typeof(int), 2); // <-- Correct way to do the conversion
if (result is int[,] factorResult)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Implementation 1 - Factors of 123456789:");
    for (int i = 0; i < factorResult.GetLength(0); i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Prime: {factorResult[i, 0]}, Exponent: {factorResult[i, 1]}");
    }
}
```

So, just to write down at least the simple example in full:

```
public static class MainImplementation1
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        // Initialize the Wolfram Engine
        IKernelLink ml = MathLinkFactory.CreateKernelLink();

        try
        {
            // Discard the initial InputNamePacket the kernel will send
            ml.WaitAndDiscardAnswer();

            ml.Evaluate("FactorInteger[123456789]");
            ml.WaitForAnswer();

            // Read the result as a 2D array of integers
            object result = ml.GetArray(typeof(int), 2);
            if (result is int[,] factorResult)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Implementation 1 - Factors of 123456789:");
                for (int i = 0; i < factorResult.GetLength(0); i++)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Prime: {factorResult[i, 0]}, Exponent: {factorResult[i, 1]}");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Unexpected result type.");
            }
        }
        catch (MathLinkException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"MathLinkException: {e.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
            // Always close the link when done
            ml.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

### MainImplementation2: Expr Tests! 

[Expression Wolfram Documentation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html) that details how to handle representing WL expressions on the C# side: the main method under test here is **GetArray**.

The result of running will be similar for this implementation:

![image](https://github.com/heseltime/SWK5-W-WolframNETLink/assets/66922223/d5daf740-e19f-4535-a9e1-cc52366be63c)

But the evaluation-processing back on the .Net side is different, now using an expression representation, for which there are two main use cases (the first is used here, to read via **GetExpr**, see the documentation at the end of this readme, and process the result and output some metadata):

```
Expr e = ml.GetExpr();
// ... Later, write it to a different MathLink:
otherML.Put(e);
e.Dispose();
```

This leads to a possibility of later writing to the MathLink - as the central communication element, implementing `IKernelLink` and produced by `MathLinkFactory`, providing the methods `WaitAndDiscardAnswer`, `Evaluate`, `WaitForAnswer` and importantly `GetExpr`.

> [!TIP]
> Many of the IKernelLink methods take either a string or an Expr. If it is not convenient to build a string of Mathematica input, you can use an Expr. There are two ways to build an Expr: you can use a constructor, or you can create a loopback link as a scratchpad, build the expression on this link with a series of Put calls, then read the expression off the loopback link using GetExpr. Here is an example that creates an Expr that represents 2+2 and computes it in Mathematica using these two techniques:

```
// First method: Build it using Expr constructors:
Expr symbolPlus = new Expr(ExpressionType.Symbol, "Plus");
Expr e1 = new Expr(symbolPlus, 2, 2);
// ml is a KernelLink
string result = ml.EvaluateToOutputForm(e1, 0);
   
// Second method: Build it on an ILoopbackLink with MathLink calls:
ILoopbackLink loop = MathLinkFactory.CreateLoopbackLink();
loop.PutFunction("Plus", 2);
loop.Put(2);
loop.Put(2);
Expr e2 = loop.GetExpr();
loop.Close();
result = ml.EvaluateToOutputForm(e2, 0);
e2.Dispose();
```

(Following the [expression class reference](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html).)

In the code the relevant part looks like:

```
// Get the result as an expression
Expr result = ml.GetExpr();

// Process the result
if (result.Head.ToString() == "List")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Implementation 2 - Factors of 123456789:");
    foreach (Expr factor in result.Args)
    {
        int prime = (int)factor.Part(1).AsInt64();
        int exponent = (int)factor.Part(2).AsInt64();
        Console.WriteLine($"Prime: {prime}, Exponent: {exponent}");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Unexpected result type.");
}
```

### MainImplementation3: Async Programming

**Full-fledged async example with callback/delagate firing**

A note on tread safety as far as expressions go:

>[!TIP]
>Like Mathematica expressions, Exprs are immutable, meaning they can never be changed once they are created. Operations that might appear to modify an Expr (like Delete) return new modified Exprs without changing the original. Because Exprs are immutable, they are also thread-safe, meaning that any number of threads can access a given Expr at the same time.
