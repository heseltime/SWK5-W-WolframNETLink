# WolframNETLink ðŸ’¥ðŸ”— - Some Tests ðŸ¥¼

Let's look at calling Wolfram [Mathematica locally using .NET](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/tutorial/CallingTheWolframLanguageFromNET.html) (C#) by leveraging the Wolfram .NET/Link library. This allows for running Wolfram Language code directly from .NET applications. I'll want to compare this with WolframAlpha calls over http since the local approach does require some:

## Setup

Mainly, point `.csproj` and provision extra dependencies like so, for MM **14.0** (and net8.0) - just add the ItemGroup and Target entries in you New Console Application in Visual Studio.

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Reference Include="Wolfram.NETLink">
      <HintPath>C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\14.0\SystemFiles\Links\NETLink\Wolfram.NETLink.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
  </ItemGroup>

  <Target Name="CopyNativeBinaries" AfterTargets="Build">
    <Copy SourceFiles="C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\14.0\SystemFiles\Links\NETLink\ml64i4.dll"
          DestinationFolder="$(OutDir)" />
  </Target>

</Project>
```

I found that the post-build process _is_ necessary. (May 2024)

## Tech Background: Symbolic Protocol

> [!NOTE]  
> The Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol (WSTP) is a platform-independent protocol for communicating between programs. In more concrete terms, it is a means to send and receive Wolfram Language **expressions**. WSTP is the means by which the notebook front end and kernel communicate with each other. It is also used by a large number of commercial and freeware applications and utilities that link the Wolfram Language and other programs or languages. It is implemented as a library of C-language functions. .NET/Link brings the capabilities of WSTP into .NET in a way that is simpler to use and much more powerful than the raw C-level API.

From [Calling the Wolfram Language from .NET](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/tutorial/CallingTheWolframLanguageFromNET.html) (May 31st, 2024, my **highlight**: we look at [expression](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html) handling on the .NET side in example 2 in the following, but ...) The idea boils down to the following:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Expr class is a representation of arbitrary Mathematica expressions in .NET. Exprs are created by reading an expression from a link (using the GetExpr method), they can be decomposed into component Exprs with properties and methods like Head and Part, and their structure can be queried with methods like Length, NumberQ, and VectorQ. All these methods will be familiar to Mathematica programmers, and their Expr counterparts work similarly.

## Project Structure and Usage

Now we try some different MainImplementations do demonstratre so use cases.

```
WolframNETLink
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainImplementation1.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainImplementation2.cs
â””â”€â”€ MainImplementation3.cs
```

### General Usage

Follow the setup and start in Visual Studio, then select the implementation want to test out: You will see a Mathematical Kernel instance pop up in the background.

### MainImplementation1: PrimeFactor 

**A simple example with array conversion to handle evaluation result**

The most interesting code here is the one making the call to the kernel evaluation, inside the infrastructure code, storing it in a suitable container and printing to console:

```
// Send a more complex command
ml.Evaluate("FactorInteger[123456789]");
ml.WaitForAnswer();

// Read the result as a 2D array of integers
int[,] factorResult = (int[,])ml.GetArray(typeof(int), 2);
Console.WriteLine("Factors of 123456789:");
for (int i = 0; i < factorResult.GetLength(0); i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Prime: {factorResult[i, 0]}, Exponent: {factorResult[i, 1]}");
}
```

### MainImplementation2: Expr tests! 

**See [Expression Wolfram Documentation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/NETLink/ref/net/Wolfram.NETLink.Expr.html) that details how to handle representing WL expressions on the C# side.**

### MainImplementation3: Async Programming

**Full-fledged async example with callback/delagate firing**

A note on tread safety as far as expressions go:

>[!TIP]
>Like Mathematica expressions, Exprs are immutable, meaning they can never be changed once they are created. Operations that might appear to modify an Expr (like Delete) return new modified Exprs without changing the original. Because Exprs are immutable, they are also thread-safe, meaning that any number of threads can access a given Expr at the same time.
